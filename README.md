# StatisticalArbitrageETFs

Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) are very popular trading and investment vehicles. An ETF is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and trades close to its net asset value over the course of the trading day. ETFs track NAV very closely but cannot track it perfectly; therefore, they often trade at a small premium or discount to their NAV. These variations in discounts are predictive of future returns. A simple trading strategy could be constructed, which buys ETFs at high discounts and sells them after other market participants (arbitrageurs) close their discounts.

## Theory of Costly Arbitrage

Sophisticated traders might not always be able to profitably eliminate mispricing between an ETF’s NAV and its price. The theory of costly arbitrage says that mispricing could persist because noise traders can cause arbitrage to be prohibitively risky, and arbitrageurs don’t have unlimited resources and indefinite risk appetite to continue in arbitrage if prices shift too far away from fundamental values. Therefore, ETFs could trade at premium/discount to fund NAV, and it is possible to find profitable arbitrage opportunities as it is presented in this simple trading strategy.
